# Growth

Coral growth is represented as a pulse-impulsive process.

# Seeding of enhanced corals

To represent seeded corals, ADRIA takes a value indicating the total number of corals to be seeded.
This value is then multiplied by their planar surface area divided by 10^4 cm2 per m2 divided by the 100 m2 reef arena,
converting the seeded population value to relative cover ($c_{r}$).

$$c_{r,i} = \pi * 1.5\text{cm}^2 / 10^4 / 10^2, i \text{indicates taxa of seeded coral}$$
