%% Example of constructing a BBN for ADRIA outputs using the BANSHEE toolbox and a small data set generated from ADRIA

% construct node names (order should match that in the data
names = {'RCP'; 'Years'; 'Guided'; 'PrSites'; 'Seed1'; 'Seed2'; 'SRM'; 'AssAdt'; 'NatAdt'; 'CC'; 'CultES'; 'ProvES'};

% construct `parent_cell`, a cell structure of size 1*(no. of nodes)
% each cell contains the parents of the node corresponding the the cell no.
% (e.g. cell no. 2 contains the parents of the Years node)
nnodes = length(names);
nmetrics = 3;

parent_cell = createParentCell(nnodes,nmetrics);

% load data into a matrix
% should have size (no. of parameter permutations)*(no. of nodes)
% (note this is a very small data set so inference outcomes may not make
% sense)
bbn_data = readmatrix('./Inputs/ADRIA_BBN_Data_example.csv');

% this data has an irrelevant column for the DMCDA algorithm variable (the
% same for every variable permutation in this case, so not included)
bbn_data(:, 2) = [];

% calculate the rank correlation matrix
% the 3rd argument tells the function to calculate the matrix from a raw
% dataset rather than probabilities, the 4th argument tells the function
% to plot the correlation matrix (0 if not)
R = bn_rankcorr(parent_cell, bbn_data, 1, 1, names);

figure(2);
% plot the bbn as a network with the rank correlation matrix values as
% weightings
bn_visualize(parent_cell, R, names, gca);

%% Inference example
% the function inference (self-explanatory) is used to make inferences on
% the network

% for example - what is the mean coral cover, CES and PES for an RCP of 2.6,
% at year 30, with guided interventions, using all sites (Prsites =3 ) and
% only seed1 and seed2 =0.0005

% nodes we know
inf_cells = [1:9];
% their values
vals = [26, 30, 1, 3, 0.0005, 0.0005, 0, 0, 0];
% make inference
% 1000,'near' -> 1000 iterations of nearest neighbour alg. to calculate
% distributions
% 'mean' -> just give the means of the distribution as output
outcome1 = inference(inf_cells, vals, R, bbn_data, 'mean', 1000, 'near');

% print results
sprintf('The average coral cover is : %1.3f, the average CES is : %1.3f, the average PES is : %1.3f', outcome1(1), outcome1(2), outcome1(3));

% make the same inference but now with incrementally increasing years and
% retrieve the full distribution
knownVars = [26, 1, 3, 0.0005, 0.0005, 0, 0, 0];
nodePos = 2;
increArray = [10,20,30,40,50];
infNodes = 1:9;
F = multiBBNInf(bbn_data, R, knownVars,infNodes,increArray,nodePos)
figure(3);
hold on
indx = 1;
plotHistMulti(F,indx,[])

legend('year 10', 'year 20', 'year 30', 'year 40', 'year 50');

% perform an inference on the interventions
% what interventions acheive cc = 0.6,ces = 0.2 and pes = 0.2 by year 50 at
% rcp 6.0, with guided interventions and all sites
F0 = inference([1:4, 10:12], [60, 10, 1, 3, 0.8, 0.2, 0.2], R, bbn_data, 'mean', 1000, 'near');
sprintf('The average intervention levels predicted are Seed1 %1.3f, Seed2 %1.3f, SRM %1.2f, As.Adt. %2.2f, Nat.Adt. %1.3f', F0)

% calculate the probability of coral cover >0.8 with no constraint on ES,
% at year 20, with rcp 6.0, with SRM = 5 and ass adpt = 6
% calculate full distribution first
F0 = inference([1:9], [60, 30, 1, 3, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0], R, bbn_data, 'full', 1000, 'near');

% find probability
dist = F0{1};
prob = calcBBNProb(dist,0.8,1);
sprintf('The probability of coral cover >0.8 for this scenario is %1.4f', prob);
